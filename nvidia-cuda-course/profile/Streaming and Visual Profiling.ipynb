    "- The code base contains a for-loop inside `main` for integrating the interbody forces calculated by `bodyForce` into the positions of the bodies in the system. This integration both needs to occur after `bodyForce` runs, and, needs to complete before the next call to `bodyForce`. Keep this in mind when choosing how and where to parallelize.\n",

Too much pinned memory can interfere with CPU performance, so use it only with intention. Pinned memory should be freed with `cudaFreeHost`.\n",
